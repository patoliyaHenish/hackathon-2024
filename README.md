# hackathon-2024
In my college, I participate in Hackathon 2024, whose theme was Sustainable Development Goals. Based on this theme, I made a project called Khedut Mitra.

Developing a 'Khedut Mitra' website for providing information related to the increase in crop production.

This website is helpful to the farmer (We are targeting Gujarat state farmers), we are providing all the information of the website in Gujarati language so, local farmer can easily understand.

In this website we are giving the infromation about how you can grow your crop and encome more after sowing the crop.

It will give you information that how much water supply you have to give as per the schedule. It will gave infromation about fertilizer, that which fertilizer you have to use to grow your seeds and crop after sowing the crop. I will suggest you to give fertilizer as per the nutrition requirement and also if any crop disease will occure it will suggest you that, for perticular disease which agro material you have to use.

These the some screenshots of the Khedut Mitra:-
